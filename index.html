I explained the recursive approach. The main idea is to traverse the tree from the root. If the current node is one of the target nodes, it is the LCA. If one target is in the left subtree and the other is in the right, the current node is the LCA. Otherwise, the LCA lies in the subtree that contains both nodes. I wrote the code and walked through an example. Complexity was O(N) time and O(H) space for the recursion stack.'}, {roundTitle: 'Round 2: On-site Coding', questions:['Given a list of words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.'], answer: 'This was a tricky one. A naive N^2 approach would time out. I explained a more optimal approach using a hash map to store the words and their indices. For each word, I split it into two parts, and if the reverse of one part exists in the map and the other part is a palindrome, we have a pair. I discussed the edge cases carefully.'}, {roundTitle: 'Round 3: System Design', questions: ['Design a URL shortening service like TinyURL.'], answer: 'I discussed functional requirements (shorten URL, redirect) and non-functional ones (high availability, low latency). I designed the API endpoints (POST /shorten, GET /{shortURL}). For the data model, I chose a NoSQL database like DynamoDB for scalability. The key challenge is generating a unique short key. I proposed using a base-62 encoding of a counter from a distributed sequence generator. We also discussed caching strategies for popular URLs to reduce latency.'}, {roundTitle: 'Round 4: Behavioral (Googlyness)', questions:['Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager.', 'How do you handle ambiguity?'], answer:'I used the STAR method to describe a situation where I had a different opinion on a technical design.

First, I clarified the goal - is it engagement, growth, or monetization? Assuming engagement, I brainstormed user personas (community admins, new members). I identified pain points like content discovery and spam. My proposed solutions included a personalized "For You" feed within groups and better moderation tools for admins. We discussed prioritization and success metrics like daily active users in groups and time spent.'}, {roundTitle: 'Round 2: Execution', questions: ['The number of posts in Facebook Groups has dropped by 10% week-over-week. How would you investigate?'], answer: 'I started by breaking down the metric "number of posts". Is the drop global or regional? Is it affecting all group types or specific ones? I outlined potential internal causes (e.g., a recent feature launch, a bug) and external factors (e.g., holidays, competitor actions).

I implemented the token bucket algorithm, which is flexible and allows for bursts of traffic. I wrote the code in a class structure, considering thread safety for a multi-threaded environment.'},{roundTitle: 'Round 2: System Design', questions: ['Design a collaborative text editor like Google Docs.'], answer: 'I focused on Operational Transforms (OT) for real-time conflict resolution. The backend would use a WebSocket server to push changes to all connected clients. I discussed the data structures on the server to maintain the document state and the OT log. We also touched upon handling cursors of different users.'}, {roundTitle: 'Round 3: Values Interview', questions: ['Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a teammate.', 'How do you approach open and honest feedback?'], answer: 'This round was challenging. I discussed a situation where a teammate and I had different technical approaches. I explained how we resolved it by creating small proof-of-concepts and letting the data decide.

For the coding question, I proposed using two heaps: a max-heap for the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap for the larger half. This allows finding the median in O(log N) time for each new number. The behavioral question was intense, and the interviewer drilled down into the details of the project and the trade-offs I made.'}] },
